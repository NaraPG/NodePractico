# Practical Node

## This repository
> In this course we learn how to create a backend oriented to microservices, understading data architecture

## Introduction
#### What is Node.js?
> Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

#### What is nodemon?
> nodemon is a tool that helps develop node. js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

## Concepts
> - `JWT`: is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way of securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.
> - `Authenthication`: enables strong authentication with public key cryptography, enabling passwordless authentication and/or secure second-factor authentication without SMS texts.
> - `Authorization`: The authorize middleware can be added to any route to restrict access to authenticated users within specified roles.
> - `MySQL`: the most popular Open Source SQL database management system, is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation.
> - `Microservices` is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are
>    * Highly maintainable and testable
>    * Loosely coupled
>    * Independently deployable
>    * Organized around business capabilities
>    * Owned by a small team

## Dependencies
> - Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
> - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
> - Install nodemon (Optional)
>   * Cloning with git or by using npm (the recommended way):
> ```
> npm install -g nodemon
> ```
>   * You can also install nodemon as a development dependency:
>   ```
>   npm install --save-dev nodemon
>   ```

## Run Code
> - Use `npm i` to install the project dependencies
> - For Windows use the command `cd [path]` and `npx nodemon [script]` to run the project automatically

## Technologies
> - JavaScript
